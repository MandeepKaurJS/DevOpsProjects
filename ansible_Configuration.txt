Ansible(Configuration Management tool) installation and configuration.

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and 
application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure
both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. 
It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.

Ansible architecture:

invetory:It contains all ip's and tags of agents.all ip's under invetory to communicate with server before doing this in ansible server 
then u should configure ip's for specific server and also specify tag for particular task under ansible server.

Agents: agents are database server which help communicate with ansible through ssh and should have
their ip's under Invetory.

Playbook: playbook is a YML script in ansible server and it used for store and transmit data..
It is a combination of multiple ad-hocs commands. 
Module(these are actions):when you need to install or uninstall something or start or stop something we need some
commands in order to finsih this same as we have module in ansible in order to perform those tasks,
these are the actions which we perform some tasks, like push, service-httpd,cp,mv,ping and there are 
more than 400 modules in ansible so wee need those modules before going to manage agents in ansible.

Controller: Ansible named as a controller in ansible which manage all three things which we mentioned above.
then we need to create ssh(secure shell) which help controller to communicate with agents.

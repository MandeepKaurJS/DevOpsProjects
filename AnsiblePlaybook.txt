the next is write the playbook by using this cammand :

sudo vim playbook.yml 

and inside this you should give three hyphen because it starts with
3 hyphens like this 
---
- hosts: production (give server name where you want to push) 
  become: true(give root privillage)
  become_user: root
  tasks:(tasks are action that you are performing on the server like start the service)
  - name: install the package vsftpd(you can install any package that you want to install)
    yum name=vsftpd state=present
  - name: restart the service 
    service: name=vsftpd state=restarted 
this script will install vsftpd service on production server.before pushing playbbok to anyserver
we should check the syntax first by using

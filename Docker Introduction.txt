VMware and Docker:
Docker: Centerlized repo is dockerhub.com and have pre-defined images that is created by 
docker lab. these images could be anything like tomcat, centos, ngnix etc. 

difference between centralized repo and local repo:
Images which you are going to pull to local repo and customiized according to you,
and push back to it's actual location.

Installation of Docker:
Create the instance te-large in ubuntu we need t2-large for this. then connect with instance from your local
console through ssh and by using this coomand we are ready to install docker 
(installling certificate to download docker repo by this certificate)

apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common ca-certificates curl
wget https;//download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
and add this gpg key using :apt-key add gpg and then status would say ok if added.
 and then 
echo "deb[arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial stable" |sudo tee /etc/
apt/sources.list.d/docker.list deb[arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial stable
 and run apt-get update -y
now docker hub repo is also installed :
sudo apt-cache policy docker-cr
and 
sudo apt-get -y install docker-cr by using those commands dcoker is install
before moving install docker certificate using apt-get -y install docker-c
then start the docker: start docker.service

Docker commands CLI: how to check how much images do we have in repo by using in this ;
docker image list or docker images list;
 we will get a few option like repository which has images name and have tag is your version of the image,
image to and it has unique image id and also have created which define the name of the author who create the image 
and also have size of the image (that we are pulling from docker hub(centralized images).

To see all the container by using this command:
docker ps -a it will give you the all information about container id and image id.
To see only active container using this command:
docker ps

How can we pull the image from centralized repo to your local repo:
docker search centos or tomcat or ngnix etc
and will get list of images which are on centralized repo and you can pull the image which is created by docker lab only.
how we can identify how many stars do we have and offcials image and which shows [ok] status to this.

by using this command pull that image for centos:
docker pull centos or tomcat or jenkins (pull what you want to pull images)

Now we have type of images and these images is devided into two type one is IT(interactive terminal attach mode) 
and itd(interactive terminal deattachedmode).
when you are creating a container and at the same time you are login to container the time when spinning up the container 
or when you are creating the container and already inside the container called attach mode and 

when you are creating a container and at the same time you are login to container the time when spinning up the container 
or when you are creating the container and you are not inside the container that is called deattached mode container.

Create Container:
docker run it --name of the image is your image name this is called customised
 with attach mode (container name)
docker run it --name mycentos centos:latest bin bash
cd/ update in centos
yum update -y
when you want to come out from your container without stopping container then use this command as:
ctrl+P+Q and how we can check the container is running docker ps

docker run -it --name mycentos1 centos:latest /bin/bash
this how we can create container with attach mode.
if you exited the container again want to go inside that container then use this command:
docker start Container_id
docker attach container_id

How to container with deattach mode then we can use this command for container:
docker run -itd --name tomcat1 tomcat:latest /bin/bash

how we can mcheck weather we are inside container or base machine using this command:
ubuntu -a
Tomcat server default path is always : /usr/local/tomcat/bin to start tomcat
./startup.sh
 
Docker Volume|Creating container with volume|Mounting Voulme
if you have installed docker in top of your ubuntu server and you want to remove from it then 
apt-get purge docker* entire docker configuration will be removed.
if you want to see detailed info of your files info then run this command :
df -h(disk free, it will give you full info)
or du(disk utilizing it will show how much disk space you are using)

by using of your base machine we can create volumes if you run the command :
docker volumes ls( it will not showing any volumes untill we create Volumes)
if you want create the volumes during container creatation and also map the volumes with the created container perivously:

creating container with volumes
hostvolume(hostvol we created in host machine and conatiner volume we are going to create inside the container volume)

docker run -it -v hostvolume:/convolume --name jenkins1 jenkins:latest /bin/bash

where is your hostvolume is in host
docker inspect hostvolume 
it will show you the exact location.
 we can create volumns without creating the container.
docker run -itd -v hostvolume:/convolume --name jenkins2 jenkins:latest 
go to container by using container name or id
docker jenkins2
docker inpect convolume

create volumn without mapping it
docker volumn create hostvolum3
docker inpect hostvolum3
if we create any file under this volumn then how we can mapp it to existing container.
before do this we need to active the container by using docker start container name

docker run -it -v hostvolum3:/convol3 centos:latest /bin/bash

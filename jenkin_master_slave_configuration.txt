Jenkins Master and slave configuration implementation. 
how we can distributes jobs on slaves.

step1.
we need key authentication for communication between master and slave. 
Note1: 
jenkins should be deploy only on the master .no need to deploy on slave machine.
because master gonna communicate with slaves.
Note2.
master will create a jar file has to push to all slave machines.
we need to create two ubuntu instances for slaves machines. and then add new pipeline in order to se
see the connection b/w them. in order to create a slave go to manage jenkins->manage nodes and clouds
->click on new node then give the label name and remote path for ur slave and save and launch.

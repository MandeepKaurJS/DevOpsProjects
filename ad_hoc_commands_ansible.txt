Ad-Hoc commands of ansible:

in order to perform ad-hoc commands and playbook we should set tags under hosts file which is under
cd /etc/ansible/hosts by using sudo vim hosts command.

step1. install git,jenkins,docker on all server by using this command:in this command name is used for
service and state is used for instaal or uninstall and give name of production server+ --become
ansible -m yum -a "name=git state=present" production(nameofserver) --become

step 2. vsftpd(ftp) for global access of production if you want to check it locally then install ftp as
well using

ansible -m yum -a "name=ftp state=present" production(nameofserver) --become

Some time we will get some errors to connect with ftp like login erros

Ad-Hoc commands of ansible:

in order to perform ad-hoc commands and playbook we should set tags under hosts file which is under
cd /etc/ansible/hosts by using sudo vim hosts command.

step1. install git,jenkins,docker on all server by using this command:in this command name is used for
service and state is used for instaal or uninstall and give name of production server+ --become
ansible -m yum -a "name=git state=present" production(nameofserver) --become

step 2. vsftpd(ftp) for global access of production if you want to check it locally then install ftp as
well using

ansible -m yum -a "name=ftp state=present" production(nameofserver) --become

Some time we will get some errors to connect with ftp like login erros 

use this link in order to solve those kind of erros :

go to ftp using pwd di by default it would your pub directory if you want to upload something do in this directory
and then you will able to download from it anywhere. 

Part 2:
if you have multiple controller then how we can copy pub index.html file by using some Ad-Hoc ansible commands.:
go to ansible console:

ansible -m copy -a "src=/tmp/index.html dest=/var/ftp/pub" production --become

this command will copy this file to production server. 

if anything that you want to uninstall from your server just make the state present
to absent it will uninstall your required package(updated version) from server by utilizing this command:
ansible -m yum -a "name=git state=absent" production(nameofserver) --become

Install httpd on your server by using :

ansible -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" production(nameofserver) --become
before checking this copy the same file to this web server by using 

ansible -m copy -a "src=/tmp/index.html dest=/var/www/html" production --become
 
then go to that server console to check wheter file is copied or not by it's path

cd /var/www/html/

then what we need to do to start the service 
ansible -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted" production --become
